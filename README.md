# AKS Flex Node

A Go agent that extends Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to non-Azure VMs, enabling hybrid and edge computing scenarios. Optionally integrates with Azure Arc for enhanced cloud management capabilities.

**Alpha Release**

Runs on Ubuntu 22.04 & 24.04 (x86_64, arm64)  
Deploy anywhere: Azure, AWS, GCP, OCI, Nebius, Tensorwave or NVIDIA DGX Spark

## Overview

AKS Flex Node transforms any Ubuntu VM into a semi-managed AKS worker node by:

- 📦 **Container Runtime Setup** - Installs and configures runc and containerd
- ☸️ **Kubernetes Integration** - Deploys kubelet, kubectl, and kubeadm components
- 🌐 **Network Configuration** - Sets up Container Network Interface (CNI) for pod networking
- 🚀 **Service Orchestration** - Configures and manages all required systemd services
- ⚡ **Cluster Connection** - Securely joins your VM as a worker node to your existing AKS cluster
- 🔗 **Azure Arc Registration** (Optional) - Registers your VM with Azure Arc for cloud management and managed identity

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Switch to root
sudo su

# Install aks-flex-node
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AKSFlexNode/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Verify installation
aks-flex-node version
```

### Usage

> **Important:** All commands below assume you are running as root (`sudo su`). The agent installs and configures system-level components (containerd, kubelet, CNI) and manages systemd services, all of which require root privileges.

```bash
# Start the agent
aks-flex-node agent --config /etc/aks-flex-node/config.json
```

For detailed setup instructions, prerequisites, requirements, and configuration options, see the **[Usage Guide](docs/usage.md)**.
